Hey I am Sandun from ITFaC UoM, Since I'm new to the FOSS and now Addicted to it. This is my first FOSS contribution hackathon. I've been lot in other hackathons, But I've learn lot of things when working in this Hackathon. New Technologies and Many more. I'm not good UI designer, But I learned lot of things about programming and collaborative works with this awesome hackathon. Thanks Mozilla Club - UWU to giving me this opportunity.
